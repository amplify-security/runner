Runner application for interfacing with https://amplify.security[Amplify Security]'s platform from continuous integration environments.

=== Building

[source]
----
docker build . -t amplifysecurity/runner
----

=== Testing Actions

Actions can be tested locally, to some extent, using https://github.com/nektos/act[nektos/act], e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
act -n -s GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" -s DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -s DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN -W .github/workflows/release.yml
----

Removing the dry-run flag (`-n`) will test this action locally for real, which currently does make changes to the `amplifysecurity/runner` repository.
